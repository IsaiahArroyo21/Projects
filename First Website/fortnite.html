        <h2>Fortnite now becomes the biggest grossing game</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Fortnite continues to smash records left and right. A new report from
        gaming data firm SuperData found that the massively successful battle
        royale game was the top-grossing free-to-play game in the world in 2018.
        In total, Fortnite raked in a whopping $2.4 billion over the course of
        2018, according to SuperData. What's more, Fortnite's status as a pop
        culture phenomenon is catching the attention of the likes of Netflix,
        who said in an earnings report released Thursday that it considers the
        game to be bigger competition than media giants HBO and Disney, as well
        as Amazon.

        Fortnite's user base has skyrocketed alongside its revenues. In
        November, it was reported that Fortnite had amassed 200 million users,
        which is a 60 percent jump from the 125 million users it had in June.
        Much of its revenue comes from in-app purchases like including new
        skins, dance moves and accessories for in-game avatars. The most
        expensive in-app item is £99.99 ($130). However, SuperData said that 34
        percent of all US players purchased a 'battle pass,' which rewards
        players for playing during a 'season,' with prizes like exclusive
        challenges, among other things. Fortnite eclipsed other free games in
        terms of revenue throughout 2018.

'The games and interactive media industry grew 13% in 2018 as Fortnite
disrupted the status quo,' SuperData explained. 'The red-hot battle royale
title generated the most annual revenue of any game in history and
popularized gaming video content (GVC) among mainstream audiences.'
Fortnite's closest competitor, 'Dungeon Fighter Online,' earned $1.5
billion vs. Fornite's $2.4 billion, while League of Legends brought in
$1.4 billion. By comparison, Pokémon Go, also a global sensation, brought
in a meager $1.3 billion. Fortnite has captured the attention of adults
and children alike since it was first released in 2017.

    Enough that Netflix is now considering Fortnite a major competitor,
    according to its latest earnings release. 'We earn consumer screen time,
    both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors,'
    Netflix wrote in a letter to shareholders. 'We compete with (and lose to)
    Fortnite more than HBO. 'Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others,
    but on how we can improve our experience for others,' the company added.
    Aside from Fortnite, Netflix also called out Google's YouTube as a
    competitor it's keeping an eye on.

    Fortnite is a game that originally launched as a disk back in July 2017
    and was then turned into a free-to-download game by its developer, Epic
    Games, in September. There are three forms of the game: 'Battle Royale',
    'Save The World' and 'Playground'. Save the world is the original form of
    the game and is currently not available to play as part of the
    free-to-download game, instead it comes as part of a £30 ($40) extra. It
    is a co-op mode with a story that's playable solo or online with friends.

    Users compete in teams of up to three to complete a variety of missions.
    It is rumoured that the game will be added to the free-to-play version of
    the game in the future. Whilst Save The World may be the original version
    of the game, its sister mode is by far the most popular. Battle Royale is
    a game of survival where players create a superhero avatar and compete
    against each other on a dystopian island. Each game, or 'match' as each
    competition is known, starts with 100 players. The aim of the game is to
    be the last one standing. Users can form allegiances and play in small
    groups. To enable this and the interactive experience, the game allows
    completely open communication between players.
